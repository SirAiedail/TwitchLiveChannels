#TwitchLiveChannels

##About the skin
This a skin for Rainmeter that displays your favourite Twitch channels online state.
This skin uses the data obtained through Twitch.tv and it's API.
It will display the channel's avatar and it's online state. Hovering over an avatar will show it's name and the current game and stream title.

##Installation & Customization
Unzip the contents of the zip file into your C:/Users/<YourUserName>/Documents/Rainmeter/Skins directory and activate the skin in Rainmeter.
Then open Variables.ini found in the @Resources folder in a text editor such as Notepad and follow the instructions there.

##Known Bugs
* Too many updates in a short amount of time will make the twitch servers block your connection temporarily and the skin will stop working for a while. There's nothing I can do about that.

##Future features
* None, I'm open for requests
